*******************TREE****************
To implement hierarichal data or info we use tree DS
In tree every node can have n no  of children

Height of a Node: Look Down & count the levels
Deapth of a Node: Look Upn & COunt the levels

If a parrent is having two children we called it has left child and right child
tree can be devided as two parts namely 
1.Left Sub Tree
2.Right Sub Tree

Note:When eever we perform any operation in tree 
     we have to complete left sub tree first and 
     we move ahead with right sub tree

Leaf Node: A node which has no children

Tree traversal
1.Level order taversal
2.Depth order traversal
